Example 1

This program starts by including the iostream library to enable input and output operations. The using namespace std; statement allows the use of standard functions like cout without the std:: prefix. The main() function serves as the program's entry point. Inside it, cout << "Hello, World!"; prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. Finally, return 0; indicates that the program executed successfully.

Example2

This program initializes four different variables: int age = 20; stores an integer value representing age, double price = 19.99; holds a decimal number for price, char grade = 'A'; stores a single character representing a grade, and string name = "Alice"; holds a sequence of characters representing a name. The cout statements print each variable's value with labels, using endl to move to a new line after each output. Finally, return 0; indicates successful program execution.

Example3

This code snippet initializes two integer variables, a and b, with values 10 and 3, respectively. It then uses cout to output the results of various arithmetic operations. The program calculates and prints the sum (a + b), difference (a - b), product (a * b), quotient (a / b), and remainder (a % b), each followed by a label for clarity. The endl is used to ensure that each output appears on a new line.

Example4

This program prompts the user to enter their name and age, stores the input in the name and age variables, and then outputs a greeting that includes both pieces of information. The cin statements read user input, while cout displays the final message.
